## 🤖 GPT Assistance (What it does)

### AI Business Expert Chatbot (Floating Widget)

The flagship AI feature is a floating chatbot accessible from anywhere in the app:

**How it works:**
1. User taps the floating orange brain icon (bottom-right corner)
2. Chat window expands with a welcoming message
3. AI asks targeted questions in a natural conversation:
   - "What type of business are you planning to start?"
   - "How many shareholders will be involved?"
   - "Will you need employment visas? If so, how many?"
   - "Will you do business inside UAE or internationally?"
4. AI analyzes responses and provides 2-3 personalized freezone recommendations
5. User taps "View" button to jump to the browser with pre-filled filters
6. Chat can be minimized and reopened anytime without losing context

**Technical details:**
- UI: Floating action button with expandable chat window
- API: OpenAI Chat Completions
- Model: gpt-4o-mini (fast and cost-effective)
- Conversation state: Managed via Riverpod `StateNotifier`
- Context: Full conversation history sent to maintain coherent dialogue
- Animations: Smooth scale transitions with `AnimationController`
- Code: `lib/ui/widgets/floating_ai_chatbot.dart` + `lib/services/ai_business_expert_service.dart`

### Company Setup Flow AI

Also available in the company setup wizard:
- Generates recommendations based on form inputs (industry, budget, visas, etc.)
- Code: `lib/services/openai_service.dart`
- Fallback: Provides default suggestions if no API key configured

**What you get:**
- Always-accessible floating chatbot (available on every screen)
- Natural, consultant-like conversation experience
- Intelligent follow-up questions based on previous answers
- Personalized freezone recommendations with clear rationale
- Seamless transition to freezone browser with pre-populated search
- Persistent conversation state (survives minimizing/reopening)
