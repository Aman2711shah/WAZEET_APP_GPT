## What's NOT Implemented Yet

### ðŸ”´ Critical - Firebase Setup Required
1. **Firebase Firestore Collection**: Need to create `/free_zones` collection
   - Upload the 47 UAE free zones data to Firestore
   - Each document should follow the structure in `assets/docs/freezones_guide.json`
   - Document ID should be the zone slug (e.g., `adgm`, `dafz`, `dso`)

2. **Firestore Indexes**: Create composite indexes for:
   - `emirate` + `name`
   - `industries` (array-contains)
   - Any other fields used in queries

3. **Firebase Rules**: Configure security rules for read access:
   ```
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /free_zones/{zoneId} {
         allow read: if true; // Public read access
         allow write: if false; // No client-side writes
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### ðŸŸ¡ Optional Enhancements
1. **OpenAI API Integration**: 
   - Purpose unclear (AI recommendations? chatbot? enhanced search?)
   - API key provided: `sk-proj-rjlsZgdjGGXPN0iqoXco9kqZd_WmOAzGDpKjpr9iKeo...`

2. **Share Functionality**: 
   - Implement zone sharing (social media, WhatsApp, email)

3. **Bookmark/Favorites**:
   - Save favorite zones to user profile
   - Requires authentication

4. **Analytics**:
   - Track popular zones
   - Track filter/sort usage
   - Search analytics

5. **Offline Support**:
   - Cache zones for offline browsing
   - Sync when back online

6. **Enhanced Comparison**:
   - Visual charts for price comparison
   - Radar chart for features
   - Export comparison as PDF

7. **Zone Recommendations**:
   - AI-powered recommendations based on user preferences
   - "Zones similar to X"

8. **Reviews & Ratings**:
   - User reviews for each zone
   - Star ratings
   - Verified reviews from actual users

9. **Contact/Inquiry Forms**:
   - In-app contact form for each zone
   - Track inquiry status
   - Integration with CRM

10. **Notifications**:
    - New zones added
    - Price changes
    - Special offers

## Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests Needed
- [ ] FreeZone model parsing
- [ ] Price calculation logic
- [ ] Filter logic
- [ ] Sort logic
- [ ] Search logic

### Integration Tests Needed
- [ ] Firebase queries
- [ ] Stream subscriptions
- [ ] Navigation flow
- [ ] Filter + sort combinations

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Search with various queries
- [ ] Apply each filter independently
- [ ] Apply multiple filters together
- [ ] Sort with different criteria
- [ ] Select zones for comparison
- [ ] View zone details
- [ ] Navigate between tabs
- [ ] Test on mobile, tablet, desktop

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Set up Firebase Firestore and upload zone data
2. **High Priority**: Test all features with real data
3. **Medium Priority**: Implement share and bookmark features
4. **Low Priority**: Clarify OpenAI API use case and implement
5. **Future**: Add reviews, recommendations, analytics

## Notes

- The app currently falls back to sample data from `assets/docs/freezones_guide.json` if Firestore is empty
- All UI components are mobile-responsive and follow Material Design guidelines
- The codebase follows Flutter best practices with proper separation of concerns
- Error handling is implemented for Firebase failures

## OpenAI API Key
Provided but purpose unclear. Potential uses:
- AI-powered zone recommendations
- Natural language search ("Find me a cheap tech zone in Dubai")
- Chatbot for zone inquiries
- Comparison insights ("Zone A is better for X because...")

**Recommendation**: Clarify the intended use case before implementing.
